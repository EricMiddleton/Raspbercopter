The Raspbercopter is an autonomous quadrocopter that uses an Arduino Mega 2560 for low-level flight controls 
and a Raspberry Pi for control via cellular internet access.

Because the Raspbercopter uses two different processors, there are two sections in this github: Arduino Code and
  Raspberry Pi code.
